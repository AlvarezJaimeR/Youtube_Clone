# Youtube_Clone

## Youtube Clone Application back-end - written in Node.js and utilizing MongoDB

This is the back-end of our front-end React app at https://github.com/AlvarezJaimeR/YouTubeCloneFE
<br>
Please see the front-end readMe for an overview of the application.

To run this app: after cloning both repos, add your MongoDB details and jwtSecret token to a default.json in the config directory.
After running `npm install` on both repositories to gather all the Node modules from your `package.json`, you can then run `npm start` for both repositories to access the app.
The front-end React app will be able to access the routes and models coded here.
This will allow you to have a working back-end to store your user data (including new registrations, new comments or replies, and likes + dislikes to the comments).
